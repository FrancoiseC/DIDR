DIDR - Decentralized Identity and Document Notarization Platform
DIDR is a decentralized identity and document notarization platform built on the Algorand blockchain. It leverages the security and scalability of Algorand to provide a tamper-proof and trustless system for managing digital identities and notarizing important documents.

Overview
DIDR is built on the Algorand blockchain and consists of four main components:

Digital identity creation
Smart contract creation
Tokenization of digital identity
Launching the DIDR platform on the Algorand blockchain
DIDR enables users to create a unique digital identity using biometric data and other identifying information. The digital identity is tokenized on the Algorand blockchain, providing users with full control over their personal information and allowing them to choose which services to share it with. A smart contract is used to create a trustless and tamper-proof system for managing digital identities and notarizing important documents. The DIDR platform is launched on the Algorand blockchain, providing users with a secure and transparent system to manage their digital identities and notarize important documents.
